`
Create a 2-4 paragraph scenario, similar to a legal case, where one party makes a claim against another.
The scenario's circumstances should be extremely ambiguous, such that strong arguments could easily be made for either party.
The scenario must end with a clear statement of the claim that is being made against one of the parties. You may include counterclaim(s).
Label the parties "Alpha" and "Bravo"--do not use names.

The scenario you write must also include:
- numbers, such as dollar values or dates.
- a specific chain of events.
- lots of small details that complicate the scenario and add evidence for either side.

The scenario may be about money, but it could also be about whether one party is at fault for some event.

Only provide the sequence of events. Do not offer any commentary about the scenario. Do not include any headers such as "CLAIM:". Just the facts.

Provide your response in a single JavaScript template string sourrounded by backticks.
